   - **employees**: `List<Employee>`
     - Represents the list of employees.
   - **departmentTotals**: `List<DepartmentTotal>`
     - Represents the list of department totals.

#### 3. **Methods**
   - **initializeEmployees()**
     - Initializes the employee data with hardcoded values.
   - **sortEmployees()**
     - Sorts the employees by their IDs.
   - **calculateNetSalaries()**
     - Calculates the net salaries for all employees.
   - **calculateDepartmentTotals()**
     - Calculates the total salaries for each department.
   - **displayEmployees()**
     - Displays the employee payroll information.
   - **displayDepartmentTotals()**
     - Displays the department salary totals.
   - **main(String[] args)**
     - The main method to run the payroll system.

#### 4. **Encapsulation**
   - All attributes are private to ensure encapsulation.
   - Public methods are provided to perform various operations on the payroll system.

#### 5. **Maintainability**
   - The class is designed to be clear and readable with meaningful method names.
   - Documentation and comments are provided to explain the purpose and usage of the class and its methods.

#### 6. **Testability**
   - The class is designed to be easily testable with unit tests.
   - Methods can be tested individually to ensure correct functionality.

### Summary
- **Encapsulation**: All attributes are private, and public methods are provided to perform various operations.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The class focuses solely on managing the payroll system.
- **Maintainability**: The class is clear, readable, and well-documented.
- **Testability**: The class is designed to be easily testable with unit tests.

This detailed class design ensures that the `PayrollSystem` class is robust, maintainable, and leverages the object-oriented features of Java.
