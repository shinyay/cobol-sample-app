When reworking COBOL code into Java, several criteria should be considered for class design to ensure the resulting code is maintainable, efficient, and leverages the object-oriented features of Java. Here are the key criteria:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
   - **Data Hiding**: Use private fields and provide public getter and setter methods to control access to the data.
   - **Modularity**: Group related data and behavior into classes to promote modularity and reusability.

### 2. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - **Cohesion**: Ensure each class has a single responsibility and encapsulates related functionality.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Separate different concerns into different classes (e.g., data representation, business logic, data access).

### 3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - **Hierarchy**: Use inheritance to create a class hierarchy where appropriate, promoting code reuse and extensibility.
   - **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Define interfaces or abstract classes to represent common behaviors and allow for polymorphic behavior.

### 4. **Composition over Inheritance**
   - **Composition**: Prefer composition over inheritance to achieve code reuse and flexibility. Use member objects to represent relationships between classes.

### 5. **Data Structures**
   - **Collections**: Use appropriate Java collections (e.g., `List`, `Map`, `Set`) to manage groups of objects.
   - **Data Types**: Map COBOL data types to appropriate Java data types (e.g., `String`, `int`, `double`).

### 6. **Error Handling**
   - **Exceptions**: Use Java's exception handling mechanism to manage errors and exceptional conditions.
   - **Validation**: Implement input validation and error checking to ensure data integrity.

### 7. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Efficiency**: Design classes and methods to be efficient in terms of memory and processing time.
   - **Scalability**: Ensure the design can handle increased load and complexity without significant performance degradation.

### 8. **Maintainability**
   - **Readability**: Write clear and readable code with meaningful class and method names.
   - **Documentation**: Provide documentation and comments to explain the purpose and usage of classes and methods.

### 9. **Testability**
   - **Unit Testing**: Design classes and methods to be easily testable with unit tests.
   - **Mocking**: Use interfaces and dependency injection to facilitate mocking in tests.
