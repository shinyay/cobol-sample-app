### Design Document for `main.cobc`

#### 1. Introduction
   - **Purpose**: This document provides a detailed design for the COBOL payroll system, outlining its functionalities, architecture, and deployment plan.
   - **Scope**: The document covers the initialization, sorting, calculation, and display of employee payroll information and department salary totals.
   - **Audience**: This document is intended for developers, testers, and system administrators involved in the development and maintenance of the payroll system.

#### 2. System Overview
   - **System Description**: The payroll system initializes employee data, sorts employees, calculates net salaries, calculates department totals, and displays the results.
   - **Objectives**: The main objectives are to automate payroll processing, ensure accurate salary calculations, and provide clear payroll information.

#### 3. Functional Requirements
   - **Employee Data Initialization**: Initialize employee data with hardcoded values.
   - **Sorting Employees**: Sort employees by their IDs using a bubble sort algorithm.
   - **Net Salary Calculation**: Calculate net salaries by computing bonuses, deductions, and tax deductions.
   - **Department Totals Calculation**: Calculate total salaries for each department by aggregating net salaries.
   - **Displaying Information**: Display employee payroll information and department salary totals on the console.

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
   - **Performance**: The system should process payroll for up to 1000 employees within 5 seconds.
   - **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to handle additional employees and departments.
   - **Maintainability**: The code should be well-documented and follow coding standards for readability and maintainability.
   - **Reliability**: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and handle errors gracefully.

#### 5. System Architecture
   - **High-Level Architecture**: The system consists of a main program that calls subroutines for initialization, sorting, calculation, and display.
   - **Components**: The main components are the employee table, sorted employee table, department totals, and subroutines for each functionality.

#### 6. Data Model

##### Data Structures
- **EMPLOYEE-TABLE**
  - EMPLOYEE-ID: PIC X(5)
  - EMPLOYEE-NAME: PIC X(20)
  - DEPARTMENT: PIC X(10)
  - GROSS-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99
  - BONUS: PIC 9(5)V99
  - DEDUCTIONS: PIC 9(5)V99
  - NET-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99
  - TAX-DEDUCTION: PIC 9(5)V99

- **SORTED-EMPLOYEE-TABLE**
  - SORT-EMPLOYEE-ID: PIC X(5)
  - SORT-EMPLOYEE-NAME: PIC X(20)
  - SORT-DEPARTMENT: PIC X(10)
  - SORT-GROSS-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99
  - SORT-BONUS: PIC 9(5)V99
  - SORT-DEDUCTIONS: PIC 9(5)V99
  - SORT-NET-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99
  - SORT-TAX-DEDUCTION: PIC 9(5)V99

- **DEPARTMENT-TOTALS**
  - DEPT-NAME: PIC X(10)
  - TOTAL-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99

- **Indexes and Rates**
  - EMPLOYEE-INDEX: PIC 9(3)
  - INNER-INDEX: PIC 9(3)
  - TAX-RATE: PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.20
  - BONUS-RATE: PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.10
  - DEDUCTION-RATE: PIC 9V99 VALUE 0.05
  - DEPARTMENT-INDEX: PIC 9(3)

- **Temporary Variables**
  - TEMP-ID: PIC X(5)
  - TEMP-NAME: PIC X(20)
  - TEMP-DEPARTMENT: PIC X(10)
  - TEMP-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99

- **Linkage Section Variables**
  - LNK-GROSS-SALARY: PIC 9(7)V99
  - LNK-BONUS: PIC 9(5)V99

##### Data Flow
- **Initialization**: Employee data is initialized with hardcoded values.
- **Sorting**: Employee data is sorted by ID and stored in the sorted employee table.
- **Net Salary Calculation**: Net salaries are calculated using gross salary, bonus, deductions, and tax deductions.
- **Department Totals Calculation**: Total salaries for each department are calculated by aggregating net salaries.
- **Display**: Employee payroll information and department salary totals are displayed on the console.

#### 7. User Interface Design
   - **Console Output**: The system displays employee payroll information and department salary totals on the console.
   - **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system by running the program and viewing the console output.

#### 8. Error Handling and Logging
   - **Error Handling**: The system validates input data and handles errors during processing.
   - **Logging**: The system logs key events and errors to a log file for troubleshooting.

#### 9. Testing Strategy
   - **Unit Testing**: Each subroutine will be tested individually to ensure correct functionality.
   - **Integration Testing**: The system will be tested as a whole to ensure all components work together.
   - **User Acceptance Testing**: End-users will validate the system to ensure it meets their requirements.

#### 10. Deployment Plan
   - **Deployment Steps**:
     1. Compile the COBOL program.
     2. Deploy the executable to the target environment.
     3. Run initial tests to ensure the system is functioning correctly.
   - **Environment Setup**: The target environment should have a COBOL compiler and runtime installed.
   - **Rollback Plan**: In case of deployment issues, revert to the previous version of the system.
