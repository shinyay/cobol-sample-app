# Legacy Code Modernization Workshop

## Step 3: Process of the COBOL code to a New Language

### Task 1: Ask GitHub Copilot to convert the code to Java

1. Open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.

2. Ask GitHub Copilot for the following:

   ```plaintext
   I would like to migrate our COBOL program to Java. COBOL and Java have different language concepts. Therefore, I need to consider what steps I should take to migrate. For example, I am aware that there are various considerations such as how to think about classes in Java, migrate subroutines and record definitions in COBOL to Java. What steps should we take to migrate from COBOL to Java?
   Please tell me the steps to migrate from COBOL to Java.
   ```

Migrating a COBOL program to Java involves several steps to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining the functionality of the original application. Here are the steps you should take:

### 1. **Understand the Existing COBOL Codebase**
   - **Inventory the Codebase**: Identify all COBOL programs, scripts, and related files.
   - **Document Functionality**: Understand and document the functionality of each COBOL program and subroutine.
   - **Identify Dependencies**: Identify internal and external dependencies, such as called programs and data sources.

### 2. **Plan the Migration**
   - **Define Scope**: Determine which parts of the COBOL codebase will be migrated.
   - **Set Objectives**: Define the goals of the migration (e.g., performance improvement, maintainability).
   - **Create a Roadmap**: Develop a detailed migration plan with timelines and milestones.

### 3. **Design the Java Architecture**
   - **Class Design**: Identify classes and objects that correspond to COBOL data structures and subroutines.
   - **Package Structure**: Organize the Java code into packages for better modularity.
   - **Error Handling**: Plan for exception handling in Java, which is different from COBOL's error handling.

### 4. **Migrate Data Structures**
   - **COBOL Records to Java Classes**: Convert COBOL record definitions to Java classes with appropriate fields.
   - **Data Types**: Map COBOL data types to Java data types (e.g., `PIC X` to `String`, `PIC 9` to `int` or `BigDecimal`).

### 5. **Migrate Subroutines**
   - **COBOL Subroutines to Java Methods**: Convert COBOL subroutines to Java methods.
   - **Method Parameters**: Use method parameters to pass data, similar to COBOL's `USING` clause.
   - **Control Structures**: Translate COBOL control structures (e.g., `PERFORM`, `IF`, `EVALUATE`) to Java control structures (`for`, `if`, `switch`).

### 6. **Implement Business Logic**
   - **Business Rules**: Ensure that all business rules and logic are correctly implemented in Java.
   - **Calculations and Algorithms**: Translate COBOL calculations and algorithms to Java.

### 7. **Handle Data Access**
   - **File I/O**: Convert COBOL file handling to Java file I/O or database access.
   - **Database Access**: Use JDBC or ORM frameworks (e.g., Hibernate) for database interactions.

### 8. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual Java classes and methods.
   - **Integration Tests**: Ensure that the integrated Java application works as expected.
   - **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate the migrated application with end-users to ensure it meets their requirements.

### 9. **Optimize and Refactor**
   - **Performance Tuning**: Optimize the Java code for performance.
   - **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### 10. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - **Deployment Plan**: Develop a plan for deploying the Java application.
   - **Documentation**: Document the new Java codebase and provide training for the development team.
   - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing maintenance and support of the Java application.

### Example: Migrating a COBOL Subroutine to Java

#### COBOL Subroutine
```cobol
INITIALIZE-EMPLOYEES.
    MOVE "E001" TO EMPLOYEE-ID(1).
    MOVE "Alice Johnson" TO EMPLOYEE-NAME(1).
    MOVE "HR" TO DEPARTMENT(1).
    MOVE 70000.00 TO GROSS-SALARY(1).
    ...
```

#### Java Method
```java
public class EmployeeInitializer {
    public static void initializeEmployees(List<Employee> employees) {
        employees.add(new Employee("E001", "Alice Johnson", "HR", 70000.00));
        ...
    }
}

public class Employee {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double grossSalary;

    public Employee(String id, String name, String department, double grossSalary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.grossSalary = grossSalary;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

By following these steps, you can systematically migrate your COBOL program to Java, ensuring that the new application is robust, maintainable, and meets the original requirements.
```

### Task 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to convert the code to Python

1. Open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.

2. Ask GitHub Copilot for the following:

   ```plaintext
   I recognize that Java, Python and COBOL are different programming models. Therefore, I believe there are different considerations related to the GAP between Python and COBOL. What steps should I take to migrate from COBOL to Python? What are the steps to migrate from COBOL to Python?
