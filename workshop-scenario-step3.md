# Legacy Code Modernization Workshop

## Step 3: Process of the COBOL code to a New Language

### Task 1: Ask GitHub Copilot to convert the code to Java

1. Open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.

2. Ask GitHub Copilot for the following:

   ```plaintext
   I am looking to migrate a COBOL program to Java. I recognize that COBOL and Java have different concepts as programming languages. Therefore, I believe that I need to consider what steps I should take when converting and migrating source code. For example, I believe there are a number of considerations, such as how classes should be thought of in Java from the COBOL language, and how to migrate COBOL subroutines and copy clauses to Java. So, what are the steps to migrate from COBOL to Java?
   ```


### Task 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to convert the code to Python

1. Open Copilot Chat with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I` or `Cmd`+`Alt`+`I`.

2. Ask GitHub Copilot for the following:

   ```plaintext
   I recognize that Java, Python and COBOL are different programming models. Therefore, I believe there are different considerations related to the GAP between Python and COBOL. What steps should I take to migrate from COBOL to Python? What are the steps to migrate from COBOL to Python?

Migrating a COBOL program to Python involves several steps to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining the functionality of the original application. Here are the steps you should take:

### 1. **Understand the Existing COBOL Codebase**
   - **Inventory the Codebase**: Identify all COBOL programs, scripts, and related files.
   - **Document Functionality**: Understand and document the functionality of each COBOL program and subroutine.
   - **Identify Dependencies**: Identify internal and external dependencies, such as called programs and data sources.

### 2. **Plan the Migration**
   - **Define Scope**: Determine which parts of the COBOL codebase will be migrated.
   - **Set Objectives**: Define the goals of the migration (e.g., performance improvement, maintainability).
   - **Create a Roadmap**: Develop a detailed migration plan with timelines and milestones.

### 3. **Design the Python Architecture**
   - **Module Design**: Identify modules and functions that correspond to COBOL data structures and subroutines.
   - **Package Structure**: Organize the Python code into packages for better modularity.
   - **Error Handling**: Plan for exception handling in Python, which is different from COBOL's error handling.

### 4. **Migrate Data Structures**
   - **COBOL Records to Python Classes**: Convert COBOL record definitions to Python classes with appropriate attributes.
   - **Data Types**: Map COBOL data types to Python data types (e.g., `PIC X` to `str`, `PIC 9` to `int` or `float`).

### 5. **Migrate Subroutines**
   - **COBOL Subroutines to Python Functions**: Convert COBOL subroutines to Python functions.
   - **Function Parameters**: Use function parameters to pass data, similar to COBOL's `USING` clause.
   - **Control Structures**: Translate COBOL control structures (e.g., `PERFORM`, `IF`, `EVALUATE`) to Python control structures (`for`, `if`, `elif`).

### 6. **Implement Business Logic**
   - **Business Rules**: Ensure that all business rules and logic are correctly implemented in Python.
   - **Calculations and Algorithms**: Translate COBOL calculations and algorithms to Python.

### 7. **Handle Data Access**
   - **File I/O**: Convert COBOL file handling to Python file I/O or database access.
   - **Database Access**: Use libraries like `sqlite3`, `SQLAlchemy`, or `pandas` for database interactions.

### 8. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual Python classes and functions.
   - **Integration Tests**: Ensure that the integrated Python application works as expected.
   - **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate the migrated application with end-users to ensure it meets their requirements.

### 9. **Optimize and Refactor**
   - **Performance Tuning**: Optimize the Python code for performance.
   - **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### 10. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - **Deployment Plan**: Develop a plan for deploying the Python application.
   - **Documentation**: Document the new Python codebase and provide training for the development team.
   - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing maintenance and support of the Python application.

### Example: Migrating a COBOL Subroutine to Python

#### COBOL Subroutine
```cobol
INITIALIZE-EMPLOYEES.
    MOVE "E001" TO EMPLOYEE-ID(1).
    MOVE "Alice Johnson" TO EMPLOYEE-NAME(1).
    MOVE "HR" TO DEPARTMENT(1).
    MOVE 70000.00 TO GROSS-SALARY(1).
    ...
```

#### Python Function
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, name, department, gross_salary):
        self.emp_id = emp_id
        self.name = name
        self.department = department
        self.gross_salary = gross_salary

def initialize_employees():
    employees = []
    employees.append(Employee("E001", "Alice Johnson", "HR", 70000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E002", "Bob Smith", "IT", 85000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E003", "Charlie Brown", "Finance", 60000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E004", "David Wilson", "Marketing", 75000.00))
    employees.append(Employee("E005", "Eve Davis", "HR", 75000.00))
    return employees

# Example usage
employees = initialize_employees()
for emp in employees:
    print(f"ID: {emp.emp_id}, Name: {emp.name}, Department: {emp.department}, Gross Salary: {emp.gross_salary}")
```

By following these steps, you can systematically migrate your COBOL program to Python, ensuring that the new application is robust, maintainable, and meets the original requirements.
